		<p><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> is an algorithmic trading platform provider who released their <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">backtesting platform called Zipline</a> to the public on GitHub.  I don&#8217;t want to sound like a broken record player regarding <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/09/21/quant-trading-for-the-public/">my thoughts</a> on openly available algorithmic trading, so suffice it to say from a technology standpoint it looks pretty cool.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that Quantopian is backed by <a href="http://www.getcollc.com/">Getco</a>, an algorithmic trading firm that makes tons of cash and always seems to be at odds with market regulators.  This has raised some well deserved suspicions from the community at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5107045">Hacker News</a>.  To make a bad analogy, this is like McDonalds opening up a chain of weight-loss gyms with freely available Big Macs for all.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/01/08/orson-welles/">Orson Welles, Biased Bios</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I fully admit I know little to nothing about art, or any of its related businesses.  But I&#8217;m particularly interested in learning about the process and thought that goes into making it.  As a software developer I think there&#8217;s a certain connection between the two.  Because whether you&#8217;re painting, making a movie, or creating an algorithm, you start from a point of ambiguity.  That is, you start off with a &#8216;blank sheet&#8217;, and if things go well somehow your head fills it with whatever you were looking for.</p>

<p>So, while randomly perusing the local library last month, I picked this book up on a whim.  My knowledge on Welles prior to reading this book was quite minimal, I had vaguely heard of him and knew he was involved in films somehow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/higham.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>What really jumped out of the pages was Welles&#8217;s staggering work ethic.  He would consistently take on multiple director positions, radio shows and movie roles at the same time.  At certain points his schedule bordered on insanity.  He would fly off to film a few scenes of a movie for a few weeks, leave to a completely different continent to direct some more scenes of a different movie, then leave to act in a role of a third movie in order to make some money to help pay off the costs of the first movie.  Confused yet?</p>

<p>For all his artistic genius Welles&#8217;s lacked some of those necessary &#8220;soft&#8221; skills needed to be successful.  By repeatedly delivering films late and constantly going over budget, he became untrusted by traditional movie studios.  Without the discipline to hit deadlines or spend wisely, Welles&#8217;s ended up having to take on many roles in movies to help pay for the costs of the films he was directing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there wasn&#8217;t much insight on the details and thought processes of Welles&#8217;s films.  The main thing I took away from a software point of view, is that when everyone is great at coding, it&#8217;ll be those ancillary soft skills that determine who the best employees are.  Because when everyone is smart, only those who can communicate well and have the discipline to ship things on time will be the most sought after.</p>

<p>On a side note, over reading this bio the author was quite content on downplaying the successes of Welles&#8217;s while focusing on the negatives and failures.  I had always assumed biographies were meant to be more scientific, portraying someone else&#8217;s life in a completely bipartisan manner.  Whether money or contempt played a factor I don&#8217;t know, but the whole thing just seemed a little odd.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Imagine lounging around on a typical weekend afternoon browsing through paper mail when you come upon this nice letter, courtesy of our IRS.</p>

<p><img src="/images/letter.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Accurate portrayal of my reaction can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NefM2gVo9mw">here</a>.</p>

<p>The photo below is a sample of what they view as unclaimed income.</p>

<p><img src="/images/statement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first two items are from when I was playing around with algorithmic trading.  I wrote a little bit about it <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/08/26/tried-algo-trading/">here</a>.  Except of course, I <em>lost</em> money.  Instead they are claiming that every single purchase I made was pure profit.  Put in other words, they claim I bought every security for nothing and so when I sold it everything was income.  If only there was a way!</p>

<p>The bottom two Vanguard items assert that I made $10,500 from US tax exempt treasuries (low risk, low return government bonds)  Also, emphasis belongs to <em>tax exempt</em>, how can you be taxed on a tax exempt security?.  But aside from that suppose  it were taxed, let&#8217;s say those funds averaged %3 annual returns this year (a generous approximation).  That would mean that I have over $350,000 invested between the two funds.  Hm let me check my accounts&#8230; nope :)</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m hopeful this will all get sorted out neatly, I&#8217;m having trouble understanding exactly how this happened.  For full disclosure I used TurboTax, which is usually a breeze especially when your tax situation isn&#8217;t complex (i.e. no income other than from your job).  So perhaps something happened there, but either way the next few weeks will be interesting.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/12/06/made-in-the-usa/">Made in the USA</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;Made in the USA&#8221; seems to be all the rage these days.  For instance, today Apple announced that they&#8217;ll start <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-apple-manufacturing-20121207,0,2720461.story">building Macs in the USA</a> again next year.  I think the underlying principle here is intuitive enough, there has been plenty of bad press regarding the conditions of foreign factories making US products.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5uYCWVfuPQ">Nike</a> is another company that comes to mind.  The stories detail sweatshop conditions, minimal salaries and long hours, in some cases even leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides">suicides</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine having to walk into these factories every day, working super long shifts for little pay and no prospects for growth.  Miserable right?  So the consensus becomes let&#8217;s take away those awful jobs and bring them back to the US where they belong.</p>

<p>The problem is, what we think are horrible conditions (which they are) are locally considered really, really good in comparison to the domestic competition.  According to  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/mr-china-comes-to-america/309160/?single_page=true">this</a> nice article at the Atlantic :</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are looking for the most-gruesome factory conditions in China, you don’t go to a  multinational giant like Foxconn, which has to deal with Western customers and pay at least some attention to appearances and laws. You go instead to the small, ramshackle, often unregulated workshops, often away from the big cities, where conditions are as inefficient and sometimes as unsafe as they were when China was just beginning to industrialize.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the overall sentiment of making products domestically.  It is an altruistic notion that we demand our products be made in safe, fair environments.  But if our long term goal is to help foreign countries improve their own working conditions, simply taking jobs away and moving them back to the US may be counterproductive.  As in, it lowers the overall supply of jobs, thereby weakening the bargaining power of the labor force, and making it easier for the sweatshops that we hate so much to subsist.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/11/11/todo-apps-are-everywhere/">Todo Apps. Are. Everywhere.</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I read an interesting article on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood&#8217;s blog</a> regarding his thoughts on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/todont.html">Todo Apps</a> and how we sometimes go overboard trying to be super organized.  I&#8217;ve fallen for the Todo App trap multiple times myself, having used <a href="https://workflowy.com/">Workflowy</a> and <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> to no avail.  They were both good apps, but at some point they each became too much of a hassle to maintain and it wasn&#8217;t worth the effort.</p>

<p>I guess what it comes down to is striking that delicate balance between being organized and actually getting stuff done.  Todo apps aren&#8217;t worthless, it&#8217;s just that if we spend all of our time finding and using one it ironically becomes detrimental to our own productivity.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ve found a pretty good app in <a href="http://www.any.do/">Any.Do</a>.  It&#8217;s simple, intuitive and syncs easily between phone/computer/tablet etc.  I don&#8217;t put every little thing on it but it&#8217;s certainly nice to have around.</p>
