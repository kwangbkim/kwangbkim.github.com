		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/09/29/on-wtf-moments-assume-positive-intent/">On Reading Code: Assume Positive Intent</a></h1>
		<time>29 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Every software developer out there in the real world has likely come across what&#8217;s known as a WTF.  In layman&#8217;s terms it means coming across code that makes no sense, either through bad techniques, design or just unnecessary &#8216;cleverness&#8217;.  See <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">here</a> for some funny examples.</p>

<p>In my early days as a professional developer I used to work up a little fit when I read stuff that made no sense at all.  But nowadays I&#8217;m pretty zen about it.  I&#8217;m reminded of this quote by Indra Nooyi, CEO of Pepsi.</p>

<blockquote><p>My father was an absolutely wonderful human being. From him I learned to always assume positive intent. Whatever anybody says or does, assume positive intent. You will be amazed at how your whole approach to a person or problem becomes very different. When you assume negative intent, you&#8217;re angry. If you take away that anger and assume positive intent, you will be amazed. Your emotional quotient goes up because you are no longer almost random in your response. You don&#8217;t get defensive. You don&#8217;t scream. You are trying to understand and listen because at your basic core you are saying, &#8220;Maybe they are saying something to me that I&#8217;m not hearing.&#8221; So &#8220;assume positive intent&#8221; has been a huge piece of advice for me.</p></blockquote>

<p>The takeaway for me is that if you get angry or negative about code, you&#8217;re wasting energy on something that&#8217;s outside of your control.  I&#8217;ve seen developers go on long rants about someone else&#8217;s work, only to later recant when they missed some detail.  It&#8217;s just not worth it.  Instead, apply that energy toward fully understanding the problem space and the developer&#8217;s intentions.  In the end, maybe the code is just bad and you&#8217;re no better off.  But you&#8217;ll be happier and more sane if you assume positive intent.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/09/17/prefer-enums-as-parameters/">Prefer Enums as Parameters</a></h1>
		<time>17 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>This post goes along with the previous one about <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2013/09/08/named-parameters-for-readability/">named parameters</a>.  I was re-reading some old notes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379471724&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=effective+java">Effective Java</a> when I came across a little snippet about why enums are preferable as parameter types over things like booleans or strings.</p>

<p>Take this example:</p>

<pre><code>public int someFormula(int value, bool isFarenheight) {
  // do some stuff...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method signature isn&#8217;t egregious, but there are a few issues.  The first is that an assumption is made that a celsius value will be passed in if isFarenheight = false.  It&#8217;s probably what the API is expecting, but who knows for sure?  I suppose the parameter could be renamed to <em>isFarenheightOrCelsius</em>.  But say, for whatever reason, a new degree type needs to be included.  Now the situation becomes more complicated.  The API developer will probably have to create a brand new method with a different name, or do a one-off overload that&#8217;ll make things even more confusing for the client developer.</p>

<p>In short, when in doubt try to prefer enums as parameter types.  It&#8217;s more readable for the developer and extensible for future changes.</p>

			<p>Here&#8217;s a nice, <a href="http://mat-mcloughlin.net/2013/08/27/using-named-parameters-for-constants.html">short post</a> I enjoyed about how to make your code more readable.  I think this is particular useful for the languages out there without a big IDE.  In .NET, using solid parameter names mitigates the usefulness of this because of intellisense.  But, overall I&#8217;ll be trying to do this more in my own code.</p>

		<time>06 August 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>This is long overdue, but the past few months have been hectic.  The main reason being I&#8217;ve transferred from my company&#8217;s Hartford, CT office to Manhattan.</p>

<p>The moving process itself was quite smooth and went without a hitch.  If you&#8217;re thinking of moving here and want to chat definitely shoot me an email.  In the meantime here&#8217;s a couple of things and thoughts that might help.</p>

<h4>Money</h4>

<p>Dollar wise, the cost of living increase isn&#8217;t all that bad, provided you can make a few sacrifices like living with a roommate and in a smaller place.  After getting a cost of living adjustment from my company, I&#8217;d probably end up making more money if I lived the same lifestyle that I did in CT.  But therein lies the problem, because there&#8217;s lots to do around here, and being stuck in a tiny apartment isn&#8217;t a lot of fun.  And it seems you can&#8217;t walk out  the door without spending $20.</p>

<h4>Finding a place</h4>

<p>I suggest starting out on this site at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/locations/new-york">airbnb</a>.  Picking out a neighborhood that suits your needs and personality makes a big difference in your NYC experience.  From there if you can narrow down your living area to a few places, you&#8217;ll have an easier time filtering stuff on Craigslist, which is still the go to for roommates and open places.</p>

<h4>Energy</h4>

<p>There really is something to say about the energy here.  A while ago I could scarcely make it past 10pm without having thoughts of going to bed.  Late nights are a regular occurrence now, whether that be working or going out.</p>

<h4>Dirty old boroughs</h4>

<p>Between my bubble boy allergies, bad air quality and loathe for walking I immediately got sick upon arriving.  When you first get here try not to go overboard and do too much too fast.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/03/23/python-slash-django-first-impressions/">Python/Django First Impressions</a></h1>
		<time>23 March 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>After a week of coding and a month of banging my head on the table trying to deploy, I finally released <a href="http://correylater-kwangbkim.dotcloud.com/correlations/">this</a>.  Yes, yes, it&#8217;s not much.  But it feels good to finally get something out there.</p>

<p>Some random thoughts as someone new to Python/Django/Web Development:</p>

<h4>Python, Very Readable</h4>

<p>I feel like Python has perhaps the lowest barrier of entry in terms of just learning to code in the language.  Coming from Java/C#, you can pretty much still code in that style using Python&#8217;s simple syntax.  Of course, you&#8217;d be missing out on all of Python&#8217;s cool and powerful features, but you&#8217;d be up and running quickly.</p>

<h4>Libraries and Tools, Everywhere</h4>

<p>If there is something you want to do in Python you can place a safe bet that there exists something that already does it.  A couple things I found that were really useful are <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8">pep8</a> and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.  Pep8 checks the style of your code because Python is big on good style and readability.  Virtualenv lets you run and test multiple versions of Python.</p>

<h4>Django</h4>

<p>Using Django is pretty sweet.  Comparing it to Rails, you can probably start up a new project in Rails faster.  But the advantage of Django is being able to use the Python language, which already has lots of stuff specifically for scientific computing, if you&#8217;re into that.  And it&#8217;s a lot easier to read than Ruby.</p>

<p>One word of advice, if you&#8217;re doing Django on your local box, do yourself a favor and set up all your stuff as you would in production.  Meaning if you&#8217;re running Postgres in production, make sure you install it on your local box.  Don&#8217;t don&#8217;t don&#8217;t use SQLite!  It&#8217;s a trap as SQLite is incredibly easy to configure, but you will be pulling your hair out later when you want to release something in the real world.</p>

<h4>Deploying</h4>

<p>My project uses the Python libraries <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> for graphing and crunching numbers.  I spent a solid three weeks trying to deploy everything to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.  Heroku downloads and installs all the prerequisites for your project.  But it had trouble installing SciPy and matplotlib.  It does offer something called <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a>, which allows you to do pretty much anything before you deploy.</p>

<p>After trying Heroku for a while I gave up and moved to <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">dotCloud</a>.  I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s much more Python friendly and installing everything was a breeze.  It only took a couple lines of code to overcome the issue that Heroku was giving me, namely that I was missing the gfortran and libatlas libraries.</p>

<h4>On Web Development</h4>

<p>I think web development can be a little daunting because it requires a large horizontal breadth of knowledge.  Just for this one project I used HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Pip, Virtualenv, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, dotCloud, postgres, nginx, YAML, markdown and probably a bunch of other stuff.  Knowing each individual component is perhaps not very difficult, but understanding everything at once will probably take some time.</p>
