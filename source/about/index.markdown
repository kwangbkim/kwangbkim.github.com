![](/images/DSC_9215.jpg)I'm a software developer with professional experience primarily in C# and VB.  I've also done projects with Java, C++, R, Flex and ActionScript and have lately been toying with web development and design.  I've started posting some of my projects to Github, you can check them out [here](https://github.com/kwangbkim).

I live in West Hartford, CT.  I graduated in '07 and have been developing software for hedge funds ever since.

Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:me@kwangbkim.com).
