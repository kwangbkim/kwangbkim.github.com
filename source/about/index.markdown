Oh, hello there.

I'm a software engineer with professional experience primarily in C# and VB.  I've also done projects with Java, C++, R, Flex and ActionScript and have lately been toying with web development and design.  I work at [Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers](https://www.gweiss.com/default.aspx).  I started posting some of my projects to [Github](https://github.com/), you can check them out [here](https://github.com/kwangbkim).

I live in West Hartford, CT.  I graduated in '07 from the University of Connecticut and have been developing software ever since.

Want to shoot the breeze?  Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:me@kwangbkim.com).
