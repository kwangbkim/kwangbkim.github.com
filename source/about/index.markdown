My name is Kwang.  I'm a software engineer born and raised in Connecticut.  I like Indian food.  I currently reside in East Village, New York City writing programs for a [hedge fund](https://www.gweiss.com/default.aspx).  I started posting some random projects to [Github](https://github.com/), you can check them out [here](https://github.com/kwangbkim).  In high school I was voted "most dazed and confused", had I been aware an election was going on I would have demanded a recount.

Want to shoot the breeze?  Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:me@kwangbkim.com).
