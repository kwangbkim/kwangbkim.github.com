Hi, my name is Kwang (pronounced Quan).  I live in Connecticut and develop software for [Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers](http://www.gweiss.com).  In my free time you can find me playing around with random software ideas ranging from algorithmic trading to the art of storytelling.

Want to reach me?  Shoot me an [email](mailto:me@kwangbkim.com).
