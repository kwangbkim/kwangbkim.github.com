I'm a software developer with professional experience primarily in C# and VB.  I've also done projects with Java, C++, R, Flex and ActionScript and have lately been toying with web development and design.  I've started posting some of my projects to Github, you can check them out [here](https://github.com/kwangbkim).

I currently reside in West Hartford, CT.  I love playing sports, basketball is my favorite.  Tennis and golf are not far behind.  I am thinking about insuring my right arm because it's deadly accurate throwing a football (kidding, but not about the accuracy!).

If you want to reach me feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:me@kwangbkim.com).
