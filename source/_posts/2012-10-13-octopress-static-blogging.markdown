I've been running this blog for a few months now without giving proper credit to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).  If you haven't heard of it, Octopress is a website generator primarily for blogging, on top of the ruby [jekyll framework](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  It's easy to use (little to no Ruby experience required), is free and hooks into [Github Hosting](http://pages.github.com/) (also free) quite nicely.  If you're thinking about starting a site it's worth checking out.
