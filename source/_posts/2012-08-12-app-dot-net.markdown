In my [Sum Zero Silicon Valley](http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/08/01/silicon-valley-and-the-timeshare-model/)  post I noted [Dalton Caldwell's](http://daltoncaldwell.com/) new venture [App.Net](http://join.app.net), a Twitter-like application focused on users and not advertising.  At the time of my writing, funding had been going on for a couple weeks but had only amassed around $150k, well short of the $500k goal.  With only a week left things were looking grim right?

Wrong!  I have to give Dalton huge props here, because with many people theorizing that funding would be well short, he remained confident.  His explanation [here](http://daltoncaldwell.com/appnet-is-not-vaporware) is pretty spot on.  It also doesn't hurt to have [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) advocating your stuff.  I think within a day of his giving a shout out to App.Net, the site was able to raise an additional $100k.

So what's next?  Well, I suppose that the real work begins.  The [API](https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec) needs to be hashed out, as that is still a work in progress.  [Sam Soffes](http://samsoff.es/posts/app-net-is-dreaming-small) made a good point in that App.Net may have marketing issues, as it seems that the product is geared more towards developers than users themselves.  The product itself still needs to be built, the only tangible thing that exists right now is a prototype and a few apps to prove the API can work.

But still, the next few months should be exciting.  I'll be watching the development of the API closely as that to me is where the real possibilities lie.  Congratulations to the App.Net team!
