Over the past few months I've noticed a couple start ups that offer the general public access to create their own algorithmic trading strategies.  One such startup I saw today on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) is called [Quant Blocks](https://quantblocks2.herokuapp.com/).

The site and product both look impressive.  What worries me is that these types of products advertise a "simple" way of making money from trading.  Certainly it's not like those infomercials you see on TV that have [Jimmy Johnson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=camXcNBLi9c) touting wares to poor souls.  But to say that making money from trading can be as easy as creating a couple rules and backtesting them against data is foolhardy.

What's worse is that I think rules based trading has the potential to invite more instability to an already crazy market.  Warren Buffet likes to refer to the market as a voting machine.  That is, when you buy Apple stock you are giving it an "up" vote that you think this stock is worth more than its current price.  So what happens when I find a successul strategy that tells me to buy Apple during the first week of June, or on November 11th before 11am, and sell it all on December 15th but only if IBM is rising that day?  It could make money, but my "vote" has become random, uninformed and worthless.  When people stop investing and start gambling in the market, needless to say bad things happen.

The bottom line is don't let this stop you from trading for fun.  But just like a casino, don't bring more money than you can afford to lose.  Treat it as entertainment and don't take it too seriously, or you might just end up at a road show listening to a semi-celebrity touting some new amazing money making invention.
