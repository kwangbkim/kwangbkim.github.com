Here's a nice, [short post](http://mat-mcloughlin.net/2013/08/27/using-named-parameters-for-constants.html) I enjoyed about how to make your code more readable.  I think this is particular useful for the languages out there without a big IDE.  In .NET, using solid parameter names mitigates the usefulness of this because of intellisense.  But, overall I'll be trying to do this more in my own code.
