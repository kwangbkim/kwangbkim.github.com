As I write this I'm surprised at how long it's been since I posted anything.  These past few months I've just been concentrating on working at [On Deck](http://www.ondeck.com), playing lots of basketball and apparently getting sick, which I am right now.  

Prior to moving to NYC I used to get sick maybe once every year or two.  Now it seems like once every couple months.  The general dirtiness and germs from millions of people around is certainly a contributing factor.  But I think it's also the mentality of living in Manhattan.  There's so many different options of things to do on every single day.  It makes you want to not waste any time, but after a little while you end up tired and overexerted.  It's a pretty messed up, hedonistic way to live.

On the other hand, I think everyone that moves here makes this kind of intrinsic agreement.  By moving here you sacrficice money, living space, cleanliness, nature, privacy and a ton of other stuff I'm neglecting to mention.  Crappy deal right?  In return, this place offers an infinite amount of experiences, basically as much as you can handle.  And I suppose that's the one thing NYC offers that other places can't.  Whether we realize it or not, we're all trying to make the most of living here because we've sacrificed so much to do so.  

So what am I planning to do next?  Probably hit Central Park.  I need to see some grass and trees and sunlight.  And is it crazy that I have to hike 30 minutes to do that?  Yes, yes it is.
