I read an [article](wapost link) recently about poetry questioning if it's now a defunct, irrelevant art.  And though in the past few years I've gotten into poetry, I must admit there are some fair points in there.  In my own experience, I find some poems to be flat out boring.  Poems written by people quite famous and well praised in the academic/artistic community.  I can't help it, I wish I enjoyed them more.  But it feels like work just to get through it because the text is so densely filled with imageries, descriptions and abstractions.

Then one day, I read this poem and it got me thinking about all of the above.  It goes like this:

> Sometimes I cry when I'm alone  
I cry because I'm on my own  
The tears I cry R bitter and warm  
They flow with life and take no form  
I cry because my heart is torn  
and I find it difficult 2 carry on  
if I had an ear 2 confide in  
I would cry among my treasured friends  
But who do u know that stops that long  
to help another carry on  
The world moves fast and it would rather pass u by  
than 2 stop and c what makes u cry  
It's painful and sad and sometimes I cry  
and no one cares about why.

That's from Tupac Shakur in a collection of poems released in a book titled [The Rose That Grew From Concrete](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rose-that-Grew-Concrete/dp/0671028456/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1380773049&sr=8-2&keywords=tupac).  I really enjoyed reading all of his stuff.  The pieces are clean, minimalistic, thoughtful and easy to understand.  

The poem above was one that stuck out to me.  I was never a big fan of Tupac, didn't know much about him and I wasn't into the 90s rap scene (though I did like [Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nay31hvEvrY) a lot).  But in less than 15 lines of text I do feel like I know him a bit and have some perspective on his life.

In the end I think the days of big, famous poems and poetry are over.  But if words on a page can still help us relate to each other, well I think that's a timeless quality.  And on that note, maybe we can send some poetry to Congress as they [don't seem to care](http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/01/politics/government-shutdown/index.html) for each other much these days.
