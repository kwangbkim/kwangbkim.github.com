I first got exposed to Delta Spirit at the 2009 Newport Folk Festival.  There was a lot of hype about them at the time.  The show was good but I didn't feel the urge to follow up.  It was catchy and energetic, but for me it lacked something lyrically that made it hard to connect to them, like it was a bit generic.  Fast forward four years later and here I am touting them as one of my favorite bands I've been listening to this year.

I came across them again while flipping randomly through some TV channels.  A movie called Warm Bodies was playing on HBO and their song Yamaha was being featured.  I was immediately curious and surprised to find that it was Delta Spirit, more on that later.  

I ended up grabbing their latest 2 albums and gave them a full listen.  Their [2010 album, History From Below](http://www.amazon.com/History-From-Below-Delta-Spirit/dp/B003EYEFC8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1384660255&sr=8-4&keywords=delta+spirit), I found to be similar to my initial impression of them.  Catchy songs, unique lyrics that tackle issues like the financial crisis.  Still, the self expression portion was either missing for me, or generic in a way that it wasn't being conveyed in a personal enough manner.

Here's a video of their song 911, off this cd.

In their latest self titled effort, [Delta Spirit](http://www.amazon.com/Delta-Spirit/dp/B006Z94A1A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384661022&sr=8-1&keywords=delta+spirit), I see as a really nice step forward as a band.  The energy and strong hooks are still there, but the lyrics have become more expressive as well.  Also, the production of the album is not to be overlooked, as their sound has become more distinct and creative.  For instance, in their song Yamaha the synthesizer is featured.  And while that may be a step away from their folksy roots, it works for me as a change in direction.

Take for example, their song California.  Lyrically, the song maintains a nice balance of honesty and clarity, without being bland or too abstract.  As for the sound, the background instrumentals promote this sense of relaxing surfer-beach-music to match the song content, but still maintains their trademark energy.
