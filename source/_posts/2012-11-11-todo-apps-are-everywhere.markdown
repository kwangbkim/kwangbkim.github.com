I read an interesting article on [Jeff Atwood's blog](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) regarding his thoughts on [Todo Apps](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/todont.html) and how we sometimes go overboard trying to be super organized.  I've fallen for the Todo App trap multiple times myself, having used [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) and [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) to no avail.  They were both good apps, but at some point they each became too much of a hassle to maintain and it wasn't worth the effort.

I guess what it comes down to is striking that delicate balance between being organized and actually getting stuff done.  Todo apps aren't worthless, it's just that if we spend all of our time finding and using one it ironically becomes detrimental to our own productivity.  

I think I've found a pretty good app in [Any.Do](http://www.any.do/).  It's simple, intuitive and syncs easily between phone/computer/tablet etc.  I don't put every little thing on it but it's certainly nice to have around.
