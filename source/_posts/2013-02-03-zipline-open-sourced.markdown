[Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) is an algorithmic trading platform provider who released their [backtesting platform called Zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline) to the public on GitHub.  I don't want to sound like a broken record player regarding [my thoughts](http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/09/21/quant-trading-for-the-public/) on openly available algorithmic trading, so suffice it to say from a technology standpoint it looks pretty cool.

It should also be noted that Quantopian is backed by [Getco](http://www.getcollc.com/), an algorithmic trading firm that makes tons of cash and always seems to be at odds with market regulators.  This has raised some well deserved suspicions from the community at [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5107045).  To make a bad analogy, this is like McDonalds opening up a chain of weight-loss gyms with freely available Big Macs for all.
