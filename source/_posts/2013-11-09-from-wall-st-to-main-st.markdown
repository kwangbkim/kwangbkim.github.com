I'm happy to announce that I've joined the financial startup [OnDeck](http://www.ondeck.com) as an engineer.  I'll be working on the data software team, helping OnDeck to collect and analyze information on small businesses looking to get quick and simple loans.  After spending the start of my career at a couple of hedge funds, I'm really excited at the prospect of being able to help small businesses grow and prosper.
