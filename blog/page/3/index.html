		<h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/29/nes/">Childhood Nostalgia: NES Cartridge Cleaning</a></h1>
		<time>29 September 2012</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>There was an <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/142550">article</a> the other day analyzing the effectiveness of blowing into NES cartridges.  The conclusion they came to was that blowing did not help at all and any perceived improvement was due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo">placebo effect</a>.</p>

<p>To which I can only reply:
<img src="/images/No.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ok, so they&#8217;re probably right, technically.  But aside from playing the Nintendo, the only thing better was trying to make the thing work.  Which it didn&#8217;t half the time.  As a kid, getting an NES was like the adolescent version of your first car.  It was old, beat up and incredibly unreliable.  But when you were able to cruise around for a while (before it broke down at the worst possible time) was it not the best thing ever?</p>

<p>In my opinion, blowing into those cartridges was all part of the NES experience.  It was like a bonding ritual.  Where I grew up you were not cool until you had a routine that seemed to work more often than not.  You were also encouraged to try special moves during times of crisis.  If you could make an NES work long enough to beat Zelda and get through Contra (with or without the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Konami Code</a>) you were basically a legend.</p>

<p>I think back to what it would have been like to sit around the NES, monotonically resetting the cartridge, hoping for a good connection.  It may have made the system work better and for longer.  But ironically, it would have been a whole lot less fun.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/21/quant-trading-for-the-public/">Quant Trading For The Public</a></h1>
		<time>21 September 2012</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve noticed a couple start ups that offer the general public access to create their own algorithmic trading strategies.  One such startup I saw today on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is called <a href="https://quantblocks2.herokuapp.com/">Quant Blocks</a>.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The site and product both look impressive.  What worries me is that these types of products advertise a &#8220;simple&#8221; way of making money from trading.  Certainly it&#8217;s not like those infomercials you see on TV that have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=camXcNBLi9c">Jimmy Johnson</a> touting wares to poor souls.  But to say that making money from trading can be as easy as creating a couple rules and backtesting them against data is foolhardy.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s worse is that I think rules based trading has the potential to invite more instability to an already crazy market.  Warren Buffet likes to refer to the market as a voting machine.  That is, when you buy Apple stock you are giving it an &#8220;up&#8221; vote that you think this stock is worth more than its current price.  So what happens when I find a successful strategy that tells me to buy Apple during the first week of June, or on November 11th before 11am, and sell it all on December 15th but only if IBM is rising that day?  It could make money, but my &#8220;vote&#8221; has become random, uninformed and worthless.  When people stop investing and start gambling in the market, needless to say bad things happen.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The bottom line is don&#8217;t let this stop you from trading for fun.  But just like a casino, don&#8217;t bring more money than you can afford to lose.  Treat it as entertainment and don&#8217;t take it too seriously, or you might just end up at a road show listening to a semi-celebrity touting some new amazing money making invention.</p>

			<p>If you have a Mac and are a developer chances are that you&#8217;re already familiar with <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/">TextMate</a>.  Well, after six years of waiting the highly anticipated sequel is out, as open source software.  Kudos to Allan Odgaard for sticking with it for so long, though many have theorized (myself included) that the project was basically being given up on, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>.</p>

<p>Well, after a few weeks it looks like the <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate">Github project</a> is alive and kicking, with tons of fixes and enhancements being added.  Check it out for yourself and see what you think.  I do highly recommend installing  <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> as it makes installing TextMate&#8217;s dependencies a cinch.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2012/08/26/tried-algo-trading/">Tried Algo Trading, Losses Ensue</a></h1>
		<time>26 August 2012</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>About a year ago I had some extra time on my hands and decided I&#8217;d take a crack at creating an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">algorithmic trading</a> strategy.  <a href="http://individuals.interactivebrokers.com/en/main.php">Interactive Brokers</a> offers an API which you can use to gather data and execute trades, though you will have to plop down the $10k minimum for an account.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick pitch of the idea I was executing.  Long story short is that it did horribly, (maybe because I didn&#8217;t want to make it do intraday trading, reason <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/08/02/knight-capital-trading-error-cost-firm-440-million/">here)</a> but if you&#8217;re interested in this stuff I&#8217;ve dumped all of my code out to <a href="https://github.com/kwangbkim/IBAlgoTrader">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On any given day most of the global markets are generally correlated.  Not only Asia/US/Europe, but emerging countries as well like Brazil and India.  But at the same time each individual country&#8217;s financial market is affected by it&#8217;s own inner dynamics.  Things like domestic and international politics can change a single economy in a way that differs from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The idea is to track each individual country&#8217;s market and compare it to some global world index.  I used Vanguard&#8217;s <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3141&amp;FundIntExt=INT">Total World Stock ETF</a>.  The price data I collected was daily and weekly.  By gathering price data based on different time intervals, I can calculate a country&#8217;s correlation to the global index over multiple time periods.  When there&#8217;s a large difference between the long term (weekly) and short term (daily) correlations, that denotes an event occurred in a particular country&#8217;s domestic market and a trade should be made.</p>

<h2>Main pitfalls</h2>

<ul>
<li>International events that affect multiple countries at the same time, triggering multiple trade alerts.  Not good because the goal is to make separate trades that are uncorrelated with each other to increase diversification and reduce variance.</li>
<li>It seemed like some events could just be rumors and dissipates quickly, or the market is just too efficient.  By the time my program noticed a correlation shift it would be too late and I&#8217;d lose money.</li>
</ul>


<p>The true moral of the story here is that retail trading should be done for fun, not for profit!</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2012/08/14/lumosity-cool-idea/">Lumosity: Cool Idea, Want Refund</a></h1>
		<time>14 August 2012</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> it&#8217;s a relatively new startup that&#8217;s been hyped up a lot by the media.  The basic premise is that playing their games, based on academic research, can help improve brain function and performance.</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty cool idea right?  I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot and signed up for a one year membership.  The first couple weeks were fine, I didn&#8217;t really feel any different.  Then it just became a chore and seeing as how I didn&#8217;t benefit, I slowly gave up on it.  I&#8217;m not going to argue whether or not the games actually help as that wasn&#8217;t the issue for me.</p>

<p>The real problem was the offered benefits to me were generally worthless.  For instance, they offered not one, but two types of games to help train your peripheral vision.  I loathed these games but was forced to play it over and over even when it wasn&#8217;t something I cared to improve.  I wanted to work on problem solving skills, hoping it would improve my abilities as a developer.  Unfortunately, they seem to only have games for simple non-complex problems like basic arithmetic.</p>

<p>So after 80 bucks down the drain there&#8217;s a simple lesson to be learned: if you want to get smarter there&#8217;s no substitute for hard work.  If you&#8217;re a developer that means writing more code, reading others, and occasionally hitting the books.  Everything else is a probably a distraction.</p>
