	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About a year ago I had some extra time on my hands and decided I&#8217;d take a crack at creating an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">algorithmic trading</a> strategy.  <a href="http://individuals.interactivebrokers.com/en/main.php">Interactive Brokers</a> offers an API which you can use to gather data and execute trades, though you will have to plop down the $10k minimum for an account.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick pitch of the idea I was executing.  Long story short is that it did horribly, (maybe because I didn&#8217;t want to make it do intraday trading, reason <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/08/02/knight-capital-trading-error-cost-firm-440-million/">here)</a> but if you&#8217;re interested in this stuff I&#8217;ve dumped all of my code out to <a href="https://github.com/kwangbkim/IBAlgoTrader">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On any given day most of the global markets are generally correlated.  Not only Asia/US/Europe, but emerging countries as well like Brazil and India.  But at the same time each individual country&#8217;s financial market is affected by it&#8217;s own inner dynamics.  Things like domestic and international politics can change a single economy in a way that differs from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The idea is to track each individual country&#8217;s market and compare it to some global world index.  I used Vanguard&#8217;s <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3141&amp;FundIntExt=INT">Total World Stock ETF</a>.  The price data I collected was daily and weekly.  By gathering price data based on different time intervals, I can calculate a country&#8217;s correlation to the global index over multiple time periods.  When there&#8217;s a large difference between the long term (weekly) and short term (daily) correlations, that denotes an event occurred in a particular country&#8217;s domestic market and a trade should be made.</p>

<h2>Main pitfalls</h2>

<ul>
<li>International events that affect multiple countries at the same time, triggering multiple trade alerts.  Not good because the goal is to make separate trades that are uncorrelated with each other to increase diversification and reduce variance.</li>
<li>It seemed like some events could just be rumors and dissipates quickly, or the market is just too efficient.  By the time my program noticed a correlation shift it would be too late and I&#8217;d lose money.</li>
</ul>


<p>The true moral of the story here is that retail trading should be done for fun, not for profit!</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/08/14/lumosity-cool-idea/">Lumosity: Cool Idea, Want Refund</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> it&#8217;s a relatively new startup that&#8217;s been hyped up a lot by the media.  The basic premise is that playing their games, based on academic research, can help improve brain function and performance.</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty cool idea right?  I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot and signed up for a one year membership.  The first couple weeks were fine, I didn&#8217;t really feel any different.  Then it just became a chore and seeing as how I didn&#8217;t benefit, I slowly gave up on it.  I&#8217;m not going to argue whether or not the games actually help as that wasn&#8217;t the issue for me.</p>

<p>The real problem was the offered benefits to me were generally worthless.  For instance, they offered not one, but two types of games to help train your peripheral vision.  I loathed these games but was forced to play it over and over even when it wasn&#8217;t something I cared to improve.  I wanted to work on problem solving skills, hoping it would improve my abilities as a developer.  Unfortunately, they seem to only have games for simple non-complex problems like basic arithmetic.</p>

<p>So after 80 bucks down the drain there&#8217;s a simple lesson to be learned: if you want to get smarter there&#8217;s no substitute for hard work.  If you&#8217;re a developer that means writing more code, reading others, and occasionally hitting the books.  Everything else is a probably a distraction.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/08/01/silicon-valley-and-the-timeshare-model/">Sum Zero Silicon Valley</a>  post I noted <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/">Dalton Caldwell&#8217;s</a> new venture <a href="http://join.app.net">App.Net</a>, a Twitter-like application focused on users and not advertising.  At the time of my writing, funding had been going on for a couple weeks but had only amassed around $150k, well short of the $500k goal.  With only a week left things were looking grim right?</p>

<p>Wrong!  I have to give Dalton huge props here, because with many people theorizing that funding would be well short, he remained confident.  His explanation <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/appnet-is-not-vaporware">here</a> is pretty spot on.  It also doesn&#8217;t hurt to have <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> advocating your stuff.  I think within a day of his giving a shout out to App.Net, the site was able to raise an additional $100k.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s next?  Well, I suppose that the real work begins.  The <a href="https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec">API</a> needs to be hashed out, as that is still a work in progress.  <a href="http://samsoff.es/posts/app-net-is-dreaming-small">Sam Soffes</a> made a good point in that App.Net may have marketing issues, as it seems that the product is geared more towards developers than users themselves.  The product itself still needs to be built, the only tangible thing that exists right now is a prototype and a few apps to prove the API can work.</p>

<p>But still, the next few months should be exciting.  I&#8217;ll be watching the development of the API closely as that to me is where the real possibilities lie.  Congratulations to the App.Net team!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a Korean-American I&#8217;ve had the luxury to follow both countries in the current Olympics.  One particular story that jumped out was about Shin Lam, the South Korean fencer who was unfairly eliminated due to a clock malfunction.  Shin Lam only had to evade getting touched for one second in order to move on to the finals.  Unfortunately, time works in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7QENF5Uf7k">mysterious ways</a>.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for her.  But in retrospect, this latest calamity makes South Korea par for the course in judging mishaps, at best.  Anyone remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJYBV9BXQNY">Roy Jones Jr.</a>?</p>

<p>Mistakes, misjudgment and mismanagement are all too common when judicial power is given to a select few.  The causes can vary from subjective bias, to incompetence, and at worst outright corruption.  It transcends not only sports like boxing and soccer, but also to organizational entities like governments.  Just ask the people living in Egypt, Syria, Tunisia or Libya.</p>

<p>Back to fencing and judging.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we treated judging like our open sourced software?  That is, a skilled and knowledgeable community working together, in the open for all to see.  I am pretty sure that more than six people exist in the world who can accurately score a fencing competition.  Why delegate such important decisions to a small group of people?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there would be tons of issues with this, specifically the logistics and time efficiency of making such decisions.  But with services like Twitter that provide instant feedback, here&#8217;s to hoping a new model can be developed so that athletes like Roy Jones Jr. and Shin Lam don&#8217;t put in four years of training to get screwed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of material on <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/">Dalton Caldwell&#8217;s</a> blog.  It&#8217;s a tiny bit Jerry Maguire-ish but over and over again I find myself nodding my head in agreement.  The latest hot topic has been the recent changes to Twitter, presumably in an attempt to gain a better position to monetize their business.</p>

<p>I think there is a fundamental flaw in the tech to marketing business model.  By saying tech to marketing, I mean a company who starts off as a tech company to attract users, who then changes to a marketing company to make money once they reach critical mass.  It&#8217;s happened to Facebook, and now it&#8217;s happening to Twitter.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong when a business tries to make money.  But something seems a bit dubious about the whole process.  It&#8217;s kind of like one of those free timeshare weekend getaways.  Seems like a nice deal, until you&#8217;re subjected to 8 hours of pitches from salesman.  Yes, those salesman were within their right to do whatever.  After all, it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re paying for anything.  But it still leaves a bad taste in your mouth doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same kind of idea with some of these tech companies.  They&#8217;ve attained users who&#8217;ve been attracted to their free service.  But now to monetize the business the focus changes from pleasing the users to pleasing the advertisers or sponsors.  It creates a sum zero relationship because it&#8217;s near impossible to keep either happy without angering the other.  In the end the advertisers are the ones paying, so they are the ones who are catered to.  Meanwhile, users and third party developers slowly get more and more annoyed until a new free service comes along and everyone joins that and the business goes bust.  Presumably the process will repeat itself.</p>

<p>Granted, not all companies have problems with this model.  <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com">StackExchange</a> offers an amazing product, is free and ad supported and is doing just fine thank you.</p>

<p>Going back to Twitter, I&#8217;ve subscribed to <a href="http://join.app.net">App.Net</a>, Dalton Caldwell&#8217;s potential alternative.  Imagine the best of Twitter: clean, no ads, completely user focused, all for four bucks a month.  But it needs to raise $500k by August 14th and it doesn&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;re going to make it.  But we can all dream can&#8217;t we?</p>
