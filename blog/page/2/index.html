			<p>This is long overdue, but the past few months have been hectic.  The main reason being I&#8217;ve transferred from my company&#8217;s Hartford, CT office to Manhattan.</p>

<p>The moving process itself was quite smooth and went without a hitch.  If you&#8217;re thinking of moving here and want to chat definitely shoot me an email.  In the meantime here&#8217;s a couple of things and thoughts that might help.</p>

<h4>Money</h4>

<p>Dollar wise, the cost of living increase isn&#8217;t all that bad, provided you can make a few sacrifices like living with a roommate and in a smaller place.  After getting a cost of living adjustment from my company, I&#8217;d probably end up making more money if I lived the same lifestyle that I did in CT.  But therein lies the problem, because there&#8217;s lots to do around here, and being stuck in a tiny apartment isn&#8217;t a lot of fun.  And it seems you can&#8217;t walk out  the door without spending $20.</p>

<h4>Finding a place</h4>

<p>I suggest starting out on this site at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/locations/new-york">airbnb</a>.  Picking out a neighborhood that suits your needs and personality makes a big difference in your NYC experience.  From there if you can narrow down your living area to a few places, you&#8217;ll have an easier time filtering stuff on Craigslist, which is still the go to for roommates and open places.</p>

<h4>Energy</h4>

<p>There really is something to say about the energy here.  A while ago I could scarcely make it past 10pm without having thoughts of going to bed.  Late nights are a regular occurrence now, whether that be working or going out.</p>

<h4>Dirty old boroughs</h4>

<p>Between my bubble boy allergies, bad air quality and loathe for walking I immediately got sick upon arriving.  When you first get here try not to go overboard and do too much too fast.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/03/23/python-slash-django-first-impressions/">Python/Django First Impressions</a></h1>
		<time>23 March 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>After a week of coding and a month of banging my head on the table trying to deploy, I finally released <a href="http://correylater-kwangbkim.dotcloud.com/correlations/">this</a>.  Yes, yes, it&#8217;s not much.  But it feels good to finally get something out there.</p>

<p>Some random thoughts as someone new to Python/Django/Web Development:</p>

<h4>Python, Very Readable</h4>

<p>I feel like Python has perhaps the lowest barrier of entry in terms of just learning to code in the language.  Coming from Java/C#, you can pretty much still code in that style using Python&#8217;s simple syntax.  Of course, you&#8217;d be missing out on all of Python&#8217;s cool and powerful features, but you&#8217;d be up and running quickly.</p>

<h4>Libraries and Tools, Everywhere</h4>

<p>If there is something you want to do in Python you can place a safe bet that there exists something that already does it.  A couple things I found that were really useful are <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8">pep8</a> and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.  Pep8 checks the style of your code because Python is big on good style and readability.  Virtualenv lets you run and test multiple versions of Python.</p>

<h4>Django</h4>

<p>Using Django is pretty sweet.  Comparing it to Rails, you can probably start up a new project in Rails faster.  But the advantage of Django is being able to use the Python language, which already has lots of stuff specifically for scientific computing, if you&#8217;re into that.  And it&#8217;s a lot easier to read than Ruby.</p>

<p>One word of advice, if you&#8217;re doing Django on your local box, do yourself a favor and set up all your stuff as you would in production.  Meaning if you&#8217;re running Postgres in production, make sure you install it on your local box.  Don&#8217;t don&#8217;t don&#8217;t use SQLite!  It&#8217;s a trap as SQLite is incredibly easy to configure, but you will be pulling your hair out later when you want to release something in the real world.</p>

<h4>Deploying</h4>

<p>My project uses the Python libraries <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> for graphing and crunching numbers.  I spent a solid three weeks trying to deploy everything to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.  Heroku downloads and installs all the prerequisites for your project.  But it had trouble installing SciPy and matplotlib.  It does offer something called <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a>, which allows you to do pretty much anything before you deploy.</p>

<p>After trying Heroku for a while I gave up and moved to <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">dotCloud</a>.  I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s much more Python friendly and installing everything was a breeze.  It only took a couple lines of code to overcome the issue that Heroku was giving me, namely that I was missing the gfortran and libatlas libraries.</p>

<h4>On Web Development</h4>

<p>I think web development can be a little daunting because it requires a large horizontal breadth of knowledge.  Just for this one project I used HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Pip, Virtualenv, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, dotCloud, postgres, nginx, YAML, markdown and probably a bunch of other stuff.  Knowing each individual component is perhaps not very difficult, but understanding everything at once will probably take some time.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/02/24/english-110/">English 110</a></h1>
		<time>24 February 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I think in todays economic climate there&#8217;s a rather strong stigma against liberal arts degrees and what relevance it has towards getting a job in the real world.  I have no views one way or the other.  But, as an engineering major I see the irony in remembering basic English as my favorite class.</p>

<p>Up until college, from pre-k to high school, I pretty much saw any non math or science class as a necessary evil.  Subjects like English or History didn&#8217;t interest me, I&#8217;d always end up going through the motions, making sure I got my A or B and moved on to the next thing.</p>

<p>So in my first day at Uconn I expected more of the same.  I still remember my professor walking into class that day.  His name was John Polchlopek.  He was young and wore lots of black.  Black coat, black shirt and black sunglasses.  Like a badass Neo who just plugged into the Matrix.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of the course material, I think we read Kafka&#8217;s The Metamorphosis.  It was tough reading and I had trouble comprehending it.  The problem in my eyes was that in reading a text you could interpret it in a million ways.  I wasn&#8217;t used to such ambiguity, where in the sciences everything is structured and proven and neat.  John taught me that lots of hard questions don&#8217;t have perfect answers and it&#8217;s important not to get too analytical in the beginning.  Just start off somewhere, anywhere, and see where that takes you.</p>

<p>English 110 got me thinking critically about writing for the first time.  Then that transitioned to other stuff like music and art.  I don&#8217;t mean to downplay any of my other classes.  I&#8217;ll always see programming, math and science as my thing.  But just having that other perspective is nice.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I really fully understood the above until a few years after I graduated.  And by then I lost contact with just about every professor.  So if you&#8217;re out there and reading this John, thanks.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> is an algorithmic trading platform provider who released their <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">backtesting platform called Zipline</a> to the public on GitHub.  I don&#8217;t want to sound like a broken record player regarding <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/09/21/quant-trading-for-the-public/">my thoughts</a> on openly available algorithmic trading, so suffice it to say from a technology standpoint it looks pretty cool.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that Quantopian is backed by <a href="http://www.getcollc.com/">Getco</a>, an algorithmic trading firm that makes tons of cash and always seems to be at odds with market regulators.  This has raised some well deserved suspicions from the community at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5107045">Hacker News</a>.  To make a bad analogy, this is like McDonalds opening up a chain of weight-loss gyms with freely available Big Macs for all.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/08/orson-welles/">Orson Welles, Biased Bios</a></h1>
		<time>08 January 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I fully admit I know little to nothing about art, or any of its related businesses.  But I&#8217;m particularly interested in learning about the process and thought that goes into making it.  As a software developer I think there&#8217;s a certain connection between the two.  Because whether you&#8217;re painting, making a movie, or creating an algorithm, you start from a point of ambiguity.  That is, you start off with a &#8216;blank sheet&#8217;, and if things go well somehow your head fills it with whatever you were looking for.</p>

<p>So, while randomly perusing the local library last month, I picked this book up on a whim.  My knowledge on Welles prior to reading this book was quite minimal, I had vaguely heard of him and knew he was involved in films somehow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/higham.JPG" title=" " alt="" /></p>

<p>What really jumped out of the pages was Welles&#8217;s staggering work ethic.  He would consistently take on multiple director positions, radio shows and movie roles at the same time.  At certain points his schedule bordered on insanity.  He would fly off to film a few scenes of a movie for a few weeks, leave to a completely different continent to direct some more scenes of a different movie, then leave to act in a role of a third movie in order to make some money to help pay off the costs of the first movie.  Confused yet?</p>

<p>For all his artistic genius Welles&#8217;s lacked some of those necessary &#8220;soft&#8221; skills needed to be successful.  By repeatedly delivering films late and constantly going over budget, he became untrusted by traditional movie studios.  Without the discipline to hit deadlines or spend wisely, Welles&#8217;s ended up having to take on many roles in movies to help pay for the costs of the films he was directing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there wasn&#8217;t much insight on the details and thought processes of Welles&#8217;s films.  The main thing I took away from a software point of view, is that when everyone is great at coding, it&#8217;ll be those ancillary soft skills that determine who the best employees are.  Because when everyone is smart, only those who can communicate well and have the discipline to ship things on time will be the most sought after.</p>

<p>On a side note, over reading this bio the author was quite content on downplaying the successes of Welles&#8217;s while focusing on the negatives and failures.  I had always assumed biographies were meant to be more scientific, portraying someone else&#8217;s life in a completely bipartisan manner.  Whether money or contempt played a factor I don&#8217;t know, but the whole thing just seemed a little odd.</p>
