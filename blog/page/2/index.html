	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Imagine lounging around on a typical weekend afternoon browsing through paper mail when you come upon this nice letter, courtesy of our IRS.</p>

<p><img src="/images/letter.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Accurate portrayal of my reaction can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NefM2gVo9mw">here</a>.</p>

<p>The photo below is a sample of what they view as unclaimed income.</p>

<p><img src="/images/statement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first two items are from when I was playing around with algorithmic trading.  I wrote a little bit about it <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/08/26/tried-algo-trading/">here</a>.  Except of course, I <em>lost</em> money.  Instead they are claiming that every single purchase I made was pure profit.  Put in other words, they claim I bought every security for nothing and so when I sold it everything was income.  If only there was a way!</p>

<p>The bottom two Vanguard items assert that I made $10,500 from US tax exempt treasuries (low risk, low return government bonds)  Also, emphasis belongs to <em>tax exempt</em>, how can you be taxed on a tax exempt security?.  But aside from that suppose  it were taxed, let&#8217;s say those funds averaged %3 annual returns this year (a generous approximation).  That would mean that I have over $350,000 invested between the two funds.  Hm let me check my accounts&#8230; nope :)</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m hopeful this will all get sorted out neatly, I&#8217;m having trouble understanding exactly how this happened.  For full disclosure I used TurboTax, which is usually a breeze especially when your tax situation isn&#8217;t complex (i.e. no income other than from your job).  So perhaps something happened there, but either way the next few weeks will be interesting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;Made in the USA&#8221; seems to be all the rage these days.  For instance, today Apple announced that they&#8217;ll start <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-apple-manufacturing-20121207,0,2720461.story">building Macs in the USA</a> again next year.  I think the underlying principle here is intuitive enough, there has been plenty of bad press regarding the conditions of foreign factories making US products.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5uYCWVfuPQ">Nike</a> is another company that comes to mind.  The stories detail sweatshop conditions, minimal salaries and long hours, in some cases even leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides">suicides</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine having to walk into these factories every day, working super long shifts for little pay and no prospects for growth.  Miserable right?  So the consensus becomes let&#8217;s take away those awful jobs and bring them back to the US where they belong.</p>

<p>The problem is, what we think are horrible conditions (which they are) are locally considered really, really good in comparison to the domestic competition.  According to  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/mr-china-comes-to-america/309160/?single_page=true">this</a> nice article at the Atlantic :</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are looking for the most-gruesome factory conditions in China, you donâ€™t go to a  multinational giant like Foxconn, which has to deal with Western customers and pay at least some attention to appearances and laws. You go instead to the small, ramshackle, often unregulated workshops, often away from the big cities, where conditions are as inefficient and sometimes as unsafe as they were when China was just beginning to industrialize.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the overall sentiment of making products domestically.  It is an altruistic notion that we demand our products be made in safe, fair environments.  But if our long term goal is to help foreign countries improve their own working conditions, simply taking jobs away and moving them back to the US may be counterproductive.  As in, it lowers the overall supply of jobs, thereby weakening the bargaining power of the labor force, and making it easier for the sweatshops that we hate so much to subsist.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I read an interesting article on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood&#8217;s blog</a> regarding his thoughts on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/todont.html">Todo Apps</a> and how we sometimes go overboard trying to be super organized.  I&#8217;ve fallen for the Todo App trap multiple times myself, having used <a href="https://workflowy.com/">Workflowy</a> and <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> to no avail.  They were both good apps, but at some point they each became too much of a hassle to maintain and it wasn&#8217;t worth the effort.</p>

<p>I guess what it comes down to is striking that delicate balance between being organized and actually getting stuff done.  Todo apps aren&#8217;t worthless, it&#8217;s just that if we spend all of our time finding and using one it ironically becomes detrimental to our own productivity.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ve found a pretty good app in <a href="http://www.any.do/">Any.Do</a>.  It&#8217;s simple, intuitive and syncs easily between phone/computer/tablet etc.  I don&#8217;t put every little thing on it but it&#8217;s certainly nice to have around.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been running this blog for a few months now without giving proper credit to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.  If you haven&#8217;t heard of it, Octopress is a website generator primarily for blogging, on top of the ruby <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll framework</a>.  It&#8217;s easy to use (little to no Ruby experience required), is free and hooks into <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Hosting</a> (also free) quite nicely.  If you&#8217;re thinking about starting a site it&#8217;s worth checking out.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/09/29/nes/">Childhood Nostalgia: NES Cartridge Cleaning</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There was an <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/142550">article</a> the other day analyzing the effectiveness of blowing into NES cartridges.  The conclusion they came to was that blowing did not help at all and any perceived improvement was due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo">placebo effect</a>.</p>

<p>To which I can only reply:
<img src="/images/No.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ok, so they&#8217;re probably right, technically.  But aside from playing the Nintendo, the only thing better was trying to make the thing work.  Which it didn&#8217;t half the time.  As a kid, getting an NES was like the adolescent version of your first car.  It was old, beat up and incredibly unreliable.  But when you were able to cruise around for a while (before it broke down at the worst possible time) was it not the best thing ever?</p>

<p>In my opinion, blowing into those cartridges was all part of the NES experience.  It was like a bonding ritual.  Where I grew up you were not cool until you had a routine that seemed to work more often than not.  You were also encouraged to try special moves during times of crisis.  If you could make an NES work long enough to beat Zelda and get through Contra (with or without the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Konami Code</a>) you were basically a legend.</p>

<p>I think back to what it would have been like to sit around the NES, monotonically resetting the cartridge, hoping for a good connection.  It may have made the system work better and for longer.  But ironically, it would have been a whole lot less fun.</p>
