	<div class="entry-content"><p>I think in todays economic climate there&#8217;s a rather strong stigma against liberal arts degrees and what relevance it has towards getting a job in the real world.  I have no views one way or the other.  But, as an engineering major I see the irony in remembering basic English as my favorite class.</p>

<p>Up until college, from pre-k to high school, I pretty much saw any non math or science class as a necessary evil.  Subjects like English or History didn&#8217;t interest me, I&#8217;d always end up going through the motions, making sure I got my A or B and moved on to the next thing.</p>

<p>So in my first day at Uconn I expected more of the same.  I still remember my professor walking into class that day.  His name was John Polchlopek.  He was young and wore lots of black.  Black coat, black shirt and black sunglasses.  Like a badass Neo who just plugged into the Matrix.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of the course material, I think we read Kafka&#8217;s The Metamorphosis.  It was tough reading and I had trouble comprehending it.  The problem in my eyes was that in reading a text you could interpret it in a million ways.  I wasn&#8217;t used to such ambiguity, where in the sciences everything is structured and proven and neat.  John taught me that lots of hard questions don&#8217;t have perfect answers and it&#8217;s important not to get too analytical in the beginning.  Just start off somewhere, anywhere, and see where that takes you.</p>

<p>English 110 got me thinking critically about writing for the first time.  Then that transitioned to other stuff like music and art.  I don&#8217;t mean to downplay any of my other classes.  I&#8217;ll always see programming, math and science as my thing.  But just having that other perspective is nice.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I really fully understood the above until a few years after I graduated.  And by then I lost contact with just about every professor.  So if you&#8217;re out there and reading this John, thanks.</p>
