	<div class="entry-content"><p>After a week of coding and a month of banging my head on the table trying to deploy, I finally released <a href="http://correylater-kwangbkim.dotcloud.com/correlations/">this</a>.  Yes, yes, it&#8217;s not much.  But it feels good to finally get something out there.</p>

<p>Some random thoughts as someone new to Python/Django/Web Development:</p>

<h4>Python, Very Readable</h4>

<p>I feel like Python has perhaps the lowest barrier of entry in terms of just learning to code in the language.  Coming from Java/C#, you can pretty much still code in that style using Python&#8217;s simple syntax.  Of course, you&#8217;d be missing out on all of Python&#8217;s cool and powerful features, but you&#8217;d be up and running quickly.</p>

<h4>Libraries and Tools, Everywhere</h4>

<p>If there is something you want to do in Python you can place a safe bet that there exists something that already does it.  A couple things I found that were really useful are <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8">pep8</a> and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.  Pep8 checks the style of your code because Python is big on good style and readability.  Virtualenv lets you run and test multiple versions of Python.</p>

<h4>Django</h4>

<p>Using Django is pretty sweet.  Comparing it to Rails, you can probably start up a new project in Rails faster.  But the advantage of Django is being able to use the Python language, which already has lots of stuff specifically for scientific computing, if you&#8217;re into that.  And it&#8217;s a lot easier to read than Ruby.</p>

<p>One word of advice, if you&#8217;re doing Django on your local box, do yourself a favor and set up all your stuff as you would in production.  Meaning if you&#8217;re running Postgres in production, make sure you install it on your local box.  Don&#8217;t don&#8217;t don&#8217;t use SQLite!  It&#8217;s a trap as SQLite is incredibly easy to configure, but you will be pulling your hair out later when you want to release something in the real world.</p>

<h4>Deploying</h4>

<p>My project uses the Python libraries <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> for graphing and crunching numbers.  I spent a solid three weeks trying to deploy everything to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.  Heroku downloads and installs all the prerequisites for your project.  But it had trouble installing SciPy and matplotlib.  It does offer something called <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a>, which allows you to do pretty much anything before you deploy.</p>

<p>After trying Heroku for a while I gave up and moved to <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">dotCloud</a>.  I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s much more Python friendly and installing everything was a breeze.  It only took a couple lines of code to overcome the issue that Heroku was giving me, namely that I was missing the gfortran and libatlas libraries.</p>

<h4>On Web Development</h4>

<p>I think web development can be a little daunting because it requires a large horizontal breadth of knowledge.  Just for this one project I used HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Pip, Virtualenv, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, dotCloud, postgres, nginx, YAML, markdown and probably a bunch of other stuff.  Knowing each individual component is perhaps not very difficult, but understanding everything at once will probably take some time.</p>
