    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> is an algorithmic trading platform provider who released their <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">backtesting platform called Zipline</a> to the public on GitHub.  I don't want to sound like a broken record player regarding <a href="http://kwangbkim.com/blog/2012/09/21/quant-trading-for-the-public/">my thoughts</a> on openly available algorithmic trading, so suffice it to say from a technology standpoint it looks pretty cool.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that Quantopian is backed by <a href="http://www.getcollc.com/">Getco</a>, an algorithmic trading firm that makes tons of cash and always seems to be at odds with market regulators.  This has raised some well deserved suspicions from the community at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5107045">Hacker News</a>.  To make a bad analogy, this is like McDonalds opening up a chain of weight-loss gyms with freely available Big Macs for all.</p>
